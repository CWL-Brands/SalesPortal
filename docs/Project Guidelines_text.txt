Why Copper CRM Integration is Critical

Why This Project Matters
This isn't just a calculator – it's a complete transformation of how Kanva Botanicals operates. By embedding directly into Copper CRM, we're creating a tool that:
1.	Saves Time: From 15 minutes to 2 minutes per quote
2.	Increases Accuracy: No more calculation errors
3.	Improves Professionalism: Consistent, branded quotes
4.	Enhances Data: Everything tracked in CRM
5.	Drives Growth: More quotes = more sales
The key to success is that this tool lives where sales reps work – inside Copper CRM. Any solution outside of Copper will fail because it adds friction to the sales process. This integration ensures the tool becomes an indispensable part of daily operations.
Project Vision
Create a quote calculator so seamlessly integrated with Copper CRM that sales reps can't imagine working without it. Every interaction should feel natural, every calculation should be instant, and every quote should strengthen customer relationships while driving revenue growth.
The ultimate goal: Make Kanva Botanicals' sales team the most efficient and professional in the botanical supplement industry.
